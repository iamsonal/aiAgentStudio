  A comprehensive framework for building AI agents that orchestrate LLM interactions, execute tools, manage memory, and coordinate multi-agent workflows—all while respecting Salesforce security and governor limits.

## What It Does

AI Agent Studio is a **production-grade orchestration system** for AI agents on Salesforce. It handles:

- **LLM interactions** with multiple providers (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini)
- **Tool execution** with governed access to Salesforce data
- **Memory management** across multi-turn conversations
- **Multi-agent workflows** with state machines and coordination
- **Email thread processing** with automatic reply generation
- **Human-in-the-loop** approvals for sensitive operations
- **Security controls** including PII masking and prompt injection detection
- **Observability** with execution traces, token tracking, and cost analytics

## Why AI Agent Studio

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Production-Ready Architecture" icon="seti:settings">
    Built with Strategy + Factory + Chain of Responsibility patterns. Modular plugin-based design scales from single conversations to high-throughput enterprise deployments.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Security & Governance First" icon="seti:lock">
    Automatic CRUD/FLS/sharing enforcement, PII masking, prompt safety checks, tool dependency validation, and comprehensive audit trails. Agents run in user context with no privilege escalation.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Extensible at Every Layer" icon="seti:code">
    Custom actions for business logic, context providers for dynamic data, LLM provider adapters, custom orchestrators, and configurable memory strategies.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Observable by Design" icon="seti:graph-line">
    Execution storyboard UI, decision step logging, tool rationale capture, token and cost tracking. Built-in visibility for monitoring reliability and business impact.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Who It Is For

## Agent Types

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Conversational Agents" icon="chat">
    Multi-turn chat assistants with memory and tool execution. Perfect for customer service, sales assistance, and interactive troubleshooting.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Function Agents" icon="seti:gear">
    Single-task specialists for classification, enrichment, and automation. Ideal for record enrichment, sentiment analysis, and automated decision-making.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Workflow Agents" icon="seti:graph-line">
    Orchestrated multi-agent execution with state machines and conditional branching. Native Salesforce reporting on workflow step performance.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Email Agents" icon="seti:mail">
    Email thread processing with automatic continuity and reply generation. Ideal for automated customer support and email triage.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Security & Trust

The framework implements multiple layers of security and trust controls:

**Platform-Native Security**: Agents run in user context, CRUD/FLS automatically enforced, sharing rules respected, all actions logged.

**PII Masking**: Hybrid approach using Salesforce Data Classification and regex patterns. Sensitive data masked before LLM calls, automatically unmasked in responses.

**Prompt Safety**: Multi-layered jailbreak detection using pattern matching, heuristic analysis, and structural analysis. Configurable response modes (Block/Sanitize/Flag).

**Tool Dependencies**: Declarative sequencing prevents illogical tool order (e.g., sending email before creating record). LLM-generated dependency graph approved by admins, enforced at runtime.

**Human-in-the-Loop**: Configurable approval workflows for sensitive operations with Confirmation, Approval, or hybrid modes.

## Key Features

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Performance">

**Multi-LLM Optimization**: Deferred DML pattern enables multiple LLM calls within a single transaction when tools don't perform DML or callouts. Reduces latency and async job overhead.

**Dead Letter Queue**: Resilient multi-record processing with priority ordering, exponential backoff, stale job recovery, and trigger-based chaining. Scales to any volume.

**Platform Events**: High-throughput async dispatch for production environments with thousands of concurrent users.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Observability">

**Execution Storyboard**: Visual UI showing complete agent execution timeline with steps, decisions, and outcomes.

**Tool Reasoning**: LLM explains why it selected each tool, captured in execution logs for transparency and debugging.

**Token & Cost Tracking**: Per-step tracking of prompt/completion tokens and estimated costs. Build dashboards to monitor spend.

**Decision Logging**: Complete audit trail of user inputs, LLM responses, tool calls, and results for compliance and troubleshooting.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Extensibility">

**Custom Actions**: Extend with business logic by creating Apex classes implementing `IAgentAction`. Full access to Salesforce data and external integrations.

**Context Providers**: Supply dynamic data to agents via `IAgentContextProvider`. Bulk-safe queries with security enforcement.

**LLM Providers**: Add new LLM providers by extending `BaseProviderAdapter`. OpenAI included, Claude and Gemini in addons.

**Memory Strategies**: Implement custom memory management via `IMemoryManager`. BufferWindow and SummaryBuffer included.
