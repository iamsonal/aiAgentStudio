## Control Plane Components

- Orchestrators: conversational, function, and workflow execution paths
- Context providers: dynamic data shaping and enrichment
- Action handlers: governed operations and integrations
- Provider adapters: OpenAI and extensible adapter pattern for additional providers
- Observability: execution traces, confidence, cost and latency analytics

## Execution Lifecycle

1. Request enters an orchestrator.
2. Prompt safety and policy checks run.
3. Context and memory are assembled.
4. LLM inference executes with selected capabilities.
5. Actions run under permission and approval constraints.
6. Execution records are persisted for analytics and auditing.
