## Security Layers

- Prompt safety checks for jailbreak and injection patterns
- PII masking before model invocation
- CRUD, FLS, and sharing enforcement
- Human-in-the-loop approvals for sensitive actions
- Detailed audit trails for requests, tool calls, and outcomes

## Recommended Baseline

1. Use sandbox-first rollout with representative data.
2. Configure least-privilege integration users.
3. Route high-risk actions through approval queues.
4. Enable dashboards and alerting for execution anomalies.
5. Review confidence and cost trends on a regular cadence.
