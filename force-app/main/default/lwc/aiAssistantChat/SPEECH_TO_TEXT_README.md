# Speech-to-Text Integration for AI Assistant Chat

## Overview

This implementation adds enterprise-grade speech-to-text functionality to the AI Assistant Chat LWC component. The solution provides a seamless voice input experience with **automatic speech detection**, robust error handling, accessibility compliance, and cross-browser compatibility.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Real-time Speech Recognition**: Live transcription with interim results
- **Multi-language Support**: 15+ languages with automatic browser language detection
- **Confidence Scoring**: Filters low-confidence results for accuracy
- **Automatic Speech Detection**: Intelligently detects when you finish speaking (no manual stop required)
- **Smart Silence Detection**: Distinguishes between thinking pauses and end-of-speech

### User Experience
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear recording indicators and status messages
- **Accessibility**: Full ARIA compliance and keyboard navigation
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-optimized interface
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of permission and network issues

### Enterprise Features
- **Security**: No audio data stored locally or transmitted unnecessarily
- **Performance**: Optimized for minimal resource usage
- **Compatibility**: Works across Chrome, Edge, Safari, and Firefox
- **Logging**: Comprehensive error tracking and debugging

## Browser Support

| Browser | Support Level | Notes |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| Chrome 25+ | Full | Best performance and feature support |
| Edge 79+ | Full | Chromium-based versions |
| Safari 14.1+ | Full | iOS Safari 14.5+ |
| Firefox | Limited | Basic support, no continuous mode |
| Opera | Full | Chromium-based versions |

## Usage

### Basic Usage
1. Click the microphone button next to the send button
2. Grant microphone permission when prompted
3. Speak your message naturally - take your time, thinking pauses are okay
4. The system automatically detects when you finish speaking and stops
5. Review the transcribed text and send

### Natural Speech Patterns
The system is designed to work with natural conversation:
- **Thinking Pauses**: Take up to 6 seconds to think before speaking
- **Mid-sentence Pauses**: Natural 2-3 second pauses won't interrupt you
- **Continuous Speech**: Speak multiple sentences without interruption
- **No Manual Management**: Focus on your message, not button clicking

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- **Escape**: Manually stop active speech recognition (rarely needed)
- **Enter**: Send message (stops speech if active)
- **Click microphone**: Start speech recognition (auto-stops when finished)

### Voice Commands
The system recognizes natural speech patterns and handles:
- Punctuation commands ("period", "comma", "question mark")
- Capitalization ("capital" or "uppercase")
- New lines ("new line" or "new paragraph")

## Configuration

### Language Settings
```javascript
// Default language is auto-detected from browser
// Can be overridden in component initialization
this._speechService = new SpeechToTextService({
    language: 'en-US', // or 'es-ES', 'fr-FR', etc.
    confidenceThreshold: 0.6, // 0.0 to 1.0
    silenceTimeout: 2500, // 2.5 seconds of silence before auto-stop
    thinkingPauseTimeout: 6000 // 6 seconds for thinking before first speech
});
```

### Automatic Detection Timing
- **Silence Timeout**: 2.5 seconds of silence after speech ends
- **Thinking Pause**: 6 seconds before first speech (allows contemplation)
- **Speech End Fallback**: 4 seconds as safety backup
- **Smart Context**: Adjusts timing based on speech patterns

### Supported Languages
- English (US, UK)
- Spanish (Spain, Mexico)
- French (France)
- German (Germany)
- Italian (Italy)
- Portuguese (Brazil)
- Japanese (Japan)
- Korean (South Korea)
- Chinese (Simplified, Traditional)
- Arabic (Saudi Arabia)
- Hindi (India)
- Russian (Russia)

### Key Components

#### SpeechToTextService
- Manages Web Speech API lifecycle
- Handles browser compatibility
- Provides error recovery and reconnection
- Implements confidence filtering
- **Automatic speech end detection** with intelligent timing
- **Context-aware pause handling** for natural speech patterns

#### Speech UI Elements
- Microphone button with state indicators
- Real-time status display
- Interim results preview
- Error message handling

#### Accessibility Features
- ARIA live regions for status updates
- Screen reader announcements
- High contrast mode support
- Reduced motion preferences

## Error Handling

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Permission Denied
- **Cause**: User denied microphone access
- **Solution**: Clear browser permissions and retry
- **Prevention**: Clear permission request messaging

#### No Speech Detected
- **Cause**: Microphone issues or ambient noise
- **Solution**: Check microphone settings, reduce background noise
- **Prevention**: Audio level indicators (future enhancement)

#### Network Errors
- **Cause**: Poor internet connection
- **Solution**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **Prevention**: Offline mode detection (future enhancement)

#### Browser Not Supported
- **Cause**: Older browser or unsupported environment
- **Solution**: Graceful degradation to text-only input
- **Prevention**: Feature detection and user notification

## Security Considerations

### Privacy
- No audio data is stored locally
- Speech processing happens in browser
- No transcripts sent to third-party services
- Microphone access requested only when needed

### Permissions
- Explicit user consent required
- Permission status clearly indicated
- Easy permission revocation
- Graceful handling of permission changes

## Performance Optimization

### Resource Management
- Service cleanup on component destruction
- Automatic timeout to prevent resource leaks
- Efficient event listener management
- Minimal DOM manipulation during recognition

### Memory Usage
- Transcript buffers cleared after use
- Service instances properly destroyed
- Event handlers removed on cleanup
- No memory leaks in long-running sessions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Speech Not Working
1. Check browser compatibility

3. Test microphone in other applications
4. Check for browser extensions blocking audio
5. Try incognito/private browsing mode

#### Speech Stopping Too Early
1. Speak more continuously without long pauses
2. Check if background noise is interfering
3. Ensure you're speaking clearly into the microphone
4. Try speaking slightly faster to maintain speech detection
5. Check console logs for timing information

#### Poor Recognition Accuracy
1. Speak clearly and at moderate pace
2. Reduce background noise
3. Check microphone positioning
4. Adjust confidence threshold
5. Try different language settings

#### Performance Issues
1. Close unnecessary browser tabs
2. Check system resource usage
3. Update browser to latest version
4. Disable browser extensions temporarily
5. Restart browser if needed

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by setting:
```javascript
window.speechDebug = true;
```

This will provide detailed console logging for troubleshooting.
