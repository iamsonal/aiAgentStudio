    <description>This setting is only respected if &apos;Is Entry Point&apos; is also checked. If true (default), the entire graph execution is immediately sent to a background job, providing a faster response to the user. If false, the framework will attempt to run the first block of synchronous steps immediately.</description>
    <inlineHelpText>Only applies to the entry point node. Check this (recommended) to run the entire process in the background. Uncheck only if you know the first step is extremely fast and you require an immediate, synchronous result.</inlineHelpText>
